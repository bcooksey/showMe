            The Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931 marked a period of increasing belligerence from the Japanese Empire, and as the decade progressed the Dutch grew concerned about the security of their East Indies colonies.[4][9] The islands, which included Java, Sumatra, Borneo and part of New Guinea, were enormously important both politically and strategically to the Dutch, who had lived and traded there for more than three centuries. Over 500,000 settlers had moved from the Netherlands to this "second homeland",[10] and the East Indies possessed abundant valuable resources, the most important of which were the rubber plantations and oil fields;[11][12] the islands were the fourth-largest exporters of oil in the world, behind the United States, Iran, and Romania.[12][A 4]
The Koninklijke Marine had only one seagoing armored ship stationed in the East Indies, the coastal-defense ship Soerabaja (ex-De Zeven Provinciën). As this ship was considered to be "of little remaining combat value", three light cruisers (Java, Sumatra and De Ruyter), a few destroyers, and a large submarine fleet were charged with the main naval defense of the islands.[13]
The Dutch believed that if war broke out, Japan's capital ships would be preoccupied with the battleships of the United States Navy and the British Royal Navy, meaning that the defenses of the East Indies would need to cope only with Japan's cruisers. However, the ships were more powerful than their Dutch equivalents and Japan would also have the advantage of numbers. It was estimated that by 1944, should no new vessels be ordered, the five light cruisers of the Koninklijke Marine (two of the Java class, which were laid down prior to the First World War, De Ruyter, and two of the Tromp class) could be facing 18 heavy and 27 light Japanese cruisers.[9][14][A 5]
These factors forced the Koninklijke Marine to bolster this force, and so the construction of three "super cruisers" capable of overpowering cruisers of the Imperial Japanese Navy was contemplated. The Washington Naval Treaty and London Naval Treaty limited new cruisers of their signatory nations to not more than a 10,000-ton displacement and 8-inch (20 cm) guns, but as a relatively minor naval power the Netherlands had not been party to the treaties and was not bound by their restrictions.[15][16] According to Dutch naval intelligence, the Japanese cruisers did not participate in exercises with the main fleet of battleships and fleet carriers, instead operating with seaplane carriers, so it was assumed that the battlecruisers would not have to face overwhelming carrier-based air strikes. Moreover, the presence of these powerful ships—whose larger guns could easily out-range any escorting cruisers or destroyers—would give the Dutch a fleet in being in the East Indies that could delay or end plans for an amphibious assault for fear that the invasion would be disrupted or the attacking fleet destroyed.[15]

            The Lightning project, announced on December 22, 2004, and currently in development by the Mozilla Foundation, produces an extension that adds calendar and scheduling functionality to the Mozilla Thunderbird mail and newsgroup client and SeaMonkey internet suite. Lightning is an iCalendar compatible calendar.
Unlike the discontinued Mozilla Sunbird and Mozilla Calendar extension, Lightning aims to integrate tightly with Thunderbird.[1]
Version 0.9 was the last planned release for Thunderbird 2. A calendar was originally to be fully integrated into Thunderbird 3, but those plans were changed due to concerns with the product's maturity and level of support.[2][3] Lightning 1.0b1 is compatible with Thunderbird 3.0, and Lightning 1.0b2 is compatible with Thunderbird 3.1.[4]

            Nikola Milev was born in Mokreni (today Variko, Florina Prefecture, Greece), a Bulgarian-populated village in Macedonia, then in the Ottoman Empire. He finished the Bulgarian primary school in his birthplace and went with his father to Cairo, Egypt, where he lived for a while. He continued his education in French Galatasaray Lisesi in Tsarigrad (Istanbul). In 1902, he was a teacher in Istanbul and worked for Simeon Radev's newspaper Evening Mail. He continued his education at the Sofia University, from where he graduated in history (1903–1909). With the recommendations of Professor Vasil Zlatarski and with a Marin Drinov scholarship, Milev specialized history in Vienna, Florence and Rome from 1910 to 1912.
During the Balkan Wars, Milev was an interpreter at the headquarters of the Second Bulgarian Army. After the Balkan Wars, he became an associate professor at the Department of Bulgarian History and History of the Balkan Nations at Sofia University (1915–1922).
In 1918 Milev, became director of the press at the Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He was among the founders of the political party People's Accord (Naroden sgovor) in 1921. In 1922, he worked as the head of the daily newspaper Slovo ("Speech"). As President of the Association of the Journalists in Sofia, he protected the freedom of speech and press and, as grandmaster of the Zora freemason's lodge, he advocated for the cause of the Macedonian Bulgarians and an autonomous Macedonia. Regardless of his negative attitude towards the policy of the Bulgarian Premier Aleksandar Stamboliyski, Milev was included in the Bulgarian delegation at the Conference of Lausanne in 1922.
Nikola Milev was considered among the potential foreign ministers of the new government after the Bulgarian coup d'état of 1923, but was rejected for of fear of the reaction of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs and Greece. He was member of Bulgarian parliament in 1923–1925 and served as adviser to the Bulgarian representation in the League of Nations in Geneva.
In 1925 Milev was selected as the representative of Bulgaria in the United States, but was killed days before his departure. The decision to kill Milev was taken by a group of Macedonian figures around Dimitar Vlahov. It is believed that Milev was one of the main ideological opponents to the Comintern and its supporters in the Macedonian movement. The decision to murder Milev was approved by Stanke Dimitrov and the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party.[1]
Milev's funeral on 15 February 1925 was one of the most crowded in Sofia in those years. His murder increased tension in the Bulgarian society in this period. The actual killer was captured by Macedonian workers, and after his confession was killed by the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO), but instead of the actual instigators, their supporters deputies Todor Strashimirov and Haralampi Stoyanov were killed.[2]
